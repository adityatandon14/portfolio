        This internship was a part of my Academic research at NUS.
        I worked in a team of 5 to develop autocompletion software that reduces lawyers workload. It trains on a corpus of 5000 legal documents, and can quite accurately predict the sentences, it reduces the time required by lawyers to complete document exponentially. The link can be found [[here]]().
    - role: Academic Intern

        Topic: Data Analytics using Deep Learning
        Associated with Dr TAN Wee Kek, Dr LEK Hsiang Hui and Dr Amirhassan Monajemi
        The aim of the project was Optimization of Portfolio and to achieve maximum returns from the graph generated from applying machine learning algorithms to past stock data. We followed a 2 step approach that involved Markovitz Theory and used Efficient Frontier analysis to create a minimum risk portfolio. Our project outperformed the stock market and could give returns up to 60 percent with the least volatility.
        It's not open source yet, ping me if you want to have a look at the code.
